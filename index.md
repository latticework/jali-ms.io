### **Jali** is

- **specification-driven** permitting consumer driven contracts and
  multi-version management
- **serverless** so you can write just your routines and run using any
  and all configurable platforms
- where the **microservice** is the unit of development, delivery and
  management
- a full multitenant, partitionable **DevOps** platform because modern
  microservice delivery is continuous
- an extensible, polyglot **framework** providing circuit breaking and
  self-documenting APIs and explicit routine services
- an **infrastructure** pluggable for many major microservice platforms
  (eventually...)

### Demonstrated Practices and Technologies

**Jali** also demonstrates state of the art development practices and
technologies.
